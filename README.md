# OCRJobCardScanner
An application to aid in the scanning of Job Cards, by using OCR.

This application improves the efficiency of Job Card scanning by only requiring the user to scan the cards and save them.
The application then traverses the dirctory and extracts the Job Card Number and moves and renames the scanned Job Card to have the number as its name.

This is significantly faster than having the user manually type the Jpb Card Number every time they scan a new one.
